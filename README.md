 The Movie Recommendation System is an intelligent application built using Machine Learning and Python that suggests movies to users based on their preferences and viewing history. The project leverages two datasets â€” one containing detailed movie information such as titles, genres, and release dates, and another including user interactions like ratings and popularity metrics. Through meticulous data preprocessing, both datasets are cleaned, standardized, and merged to create a unified data frame that serves as the foundation for model training.

To enhance data quality, missing values are handled, duplicate records are removed, and text features such as movie overviews and genres are transformed into numerical representations using techniques like TF-IDF Vectorization and Count Vectorization. These vectors help the model understand the similarity between different movies based on content and user behavior. The cosine similarity metric is then used to measure closeness between movies, enabling the system to recommend films that share similar attributes or appeal to users with comparable tastes.
The machine learning pipeline is developed using Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and NLTK, ensuring efficient data manipulation and model accuracy. Finally, the entire system is deployed using Streamlit, providing an interactive and visually engaging web interface where users can enter a movie name and instantly receive top personalized recommendations.
